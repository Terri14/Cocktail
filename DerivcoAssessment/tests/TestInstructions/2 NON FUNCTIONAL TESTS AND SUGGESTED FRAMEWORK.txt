2 NON FUNCTIONAL TESTS AND SUGGESTED FRAMEWORK

1. Load Testing:

Description: 
	Assess how the system performs under expected load conditions.
Configuration: 
	Configure the number of concurrent users, requests per second, and duration of the test.
	Specify inputs for requests to endpoint, set number of users, loop to simulate high usage over extended period
	Add timers to simulate realistic user times
	Add assertions to validate responses from API
Metrics: 
	Measure response times, throughput, and resource utilization.

2. Stress Testing:

Description: 
	Determine the system's breaking point and identify performance bottlenecks.
Configuration: 
	Gradually increase the load until the system becomes unstable.
	Set concurrent users to amount that exceeds capacity
	Loop to maintain constant load
	Listeners: look for signs of system instability
	Exercise with Caution!
Metrics: 
	Identify errors, timeouts, and resource exhaustion.

Automation Framework for Non-Functional Tests:
	Apache JMeter: simulates large number of users making request to the API and measure response times
