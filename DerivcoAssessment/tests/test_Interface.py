    # This test combines web automation and API automation to verify the correctness of cocktail names.
    # It performs the following steps:
    # Step 1: Navigate to https://www.thecocktaildb.com and scrape the web page for names of all drinks
    #   (620 cocktails found).
    # Step 2: Make 620 API calls to Search cocktail by name, extract drinkId of all drinks found, and append them
    #   to a list.
    # Step 3: Extract drinkID's from the list obtained in step 2 and use them as input for the next step.
    # Step 4: Make 620 API calls to Lookup full cocktail details by ID API, extract drink names.
    # Step 5: Compare the drink names scraped in Step 1 to the drink names looked up by IDs to check for correctness.
    # This test takes about 5 minutes to complete.
